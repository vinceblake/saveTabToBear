# saveTabToBear
Alfred workflow to save current Chrome tab to a Bear note for later reference. It requires python3 and [xcall.app](https://github.com/robwalton/python-xcall), created by Martin Finke and included in this repository.


## Preparation
You can either clone this repository on your local machine using:

`git clone https://github.com/vinceblake/saveTabToBear.git`

Or you can download the .zip file directly and extract it. 

Place `onetabtobear.py` file and `xcall.app` somewhere safe. Anywhere you like is fine but they'll need to live there permanently. You'll also need to reference their locations in a moment.

---

Open up your Bear application and create a new note. The first line should look something like this (call it what you want, but remember the title):

---

Now that we've got our title, we'll need our note's unique identifier. Click the three dots in the upper right of the note and select `Copy Note's Identifier`:

## Installation
With the above steps complete, simply double-click the `.alfredworkflow` file to import it into Alfred. You'll be greeted with a screen that includes something like this:

You will need to update these variables for this to work.
* `bearDbFile`: Where your [Bear notes database](https://bear.app/faq/Where%20are%20Bear's%20notes%20located/) is located. This will almost certainly be `/Users/[YOUR USERNAME]/Library/Group Containers/9K33E3U3T4.net.shinyfrog.bear/Application Data/database.sqlite`
* `bearNoteID`: The unique identifier you copied above. Just paste it in here.
* `bearNoteTitle`: I call it BearMarks. You can call it whatever you like. Just make sure it matches what you created in the Preparation steps. 
* `scriptLocation`: Wherever you chose to place the onetabtobear.py file. 
* `xCallApp`: Wherever you chose to place xcall.app. I like having it in my Applications folder, but it can be run from anywhere.

## Usage
The hotkey defined in the first item of the workflow is what you will press within Chrome to save the tab to Bear. It can be whatever you like.

This workflow creates a "to-do" list of links for you to check out later. By default, the code will remove any items that are "checked off" in the list when the script is run. It will also remove any dates which contain no links beneath them. If you don't want it do that, simply modify the onetabtobear.py file and set `removeCheckedItems = False` instead of `True` in line #8.
